# Origin Identity Acess Management

## Overview

This repository contains the first version of the OriginIAM implementation. This service is part of a microservices architecture designed to manage both direct user sign-ups and employer-based user eligibility.

![System Architecture](basic_version_OriginIAM.png)

In this architecture, the User and Employer services are created to facilitate testing by creating a mini storage in memory using a dictionary. The architecture has a redis to cache eligible employers and speed up the signup request and a postgresql to store a report of the last eligibilityFile processing run. To make testing easier, the reports can be retrieved via get from the eligibility file controller. The input data has syntactic validation in the api layer and semantic validation in the other layers. 

The return from the eligibility api will provide the link to navigate to the previous result of processing the file. Current processing is approximately ~300 lines per second. The backlog includes proposals to improve the performance and use of the database.
 

## API Documentation

### Signup API

- **Endpoint**: `POST /signup`
- **Description**: Registers a new user.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "MFx6|>V;)eo)/?NwEH<aiV#mrNrr1ANr0[>##h!iTn)baIY[>I",
    "country": "st",
    "acceptTerms": true,
    "fullName": "string",
    "birthDate": "2024-04-12"
  }
  ```

### Eligibility File API

- **Endpoint**: `POST /eligibility`
- **Description**: Processes a CSV file from a given URL to manage user access based on employer records.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "file": "http://url-to-csv.com/file.csv",
    "employer_name": "Torvalds"
  }
  ```
To meet the needs of the different types of companies we can integrate, two endpoints have been designated:

- `POST /eligibilityfile/small-company-eligibility` - will handle requests from companies up to 10,000 employees. 
- `POST /eligibilityfile`  will handle requests from any group of employees.

This differentiation was made simply to create the opportunity to return the processing report in real time to our customers who have small companies. Even so, it is possible for them to retrieve the report later without any problems. 


- `GET /EligibilityFile/reports?employerName=<CompanyName>&pageNumber=1&pageSize=10`

 
## Getting Started

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/origin-user-access.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd originIAM
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Infra Check

Database: ```bash
			docker exec -it <container_id> psql  -U user -d origin_db
			```

Redis: 	```bash
			docker exec -it <container_id> redis-cli
			```		


### Running Tests
Execute the following command to run the automated tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Usage
Locally (IIs) - Refer to the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:44361/swagger) for testing and interacting with the API after running the application.
